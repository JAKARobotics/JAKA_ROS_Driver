# request: command specification for motion executions.
# Units:
#	joint space/angles: radian, radian/s and radian/s^2.
#	Cartesian space: mm, mm/s, and mm/s^2.
#	time: sec

# pose： target coordinate. 
#	For Joint Space target，pose dimention is the number of joints. element as each target joint position.
#	For Cartesian target: pose dimention is 6 for (x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw)

#Is there a reference solution 
bool has_ref
#Send if there is, empty array if not 
float32[] ref_joint

# mvvelo: specified maximum velocity during execution. linear or angular velocity 
float32 mvvelo
# mvacc: specified maximum acceleration during execution. linear or angular acceleration.
float32 mvacc
# mvtime: currently do not have any special meaning, please just give it 0.
float32 mvtime
# mvradii: this is special for move_ineb service, meaning the blending radius between 2 straight path trajectories, 0 for no blend.
